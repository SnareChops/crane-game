====================
If you know, you know.

- No dependencies to install
- Build `index.ts` into a bundled `index.js` and serve however you like.
- For convenience I've included a `run` script that uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#install-esbuild) and [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to build and serve.
